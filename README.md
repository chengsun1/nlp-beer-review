<p>This is the 2026-revamped-version of the original univeristy coursework.However, due to limitations in the computational power (we no longer have access to google colab), it is not possible for this model to run on my local macbook air M2 </p>
<br>
<p>The general aim is to classify the reviews into three classes [okay, good, excellent], and I utilised a bert model to train the model predict the prediction set. </p>

<p> Detailed question sheet is in the pdf file </p>
